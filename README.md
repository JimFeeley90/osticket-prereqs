<h2>Install / Enable IIS in Windows WITH CGI: To install or enable IIS (Internet Information Services) with CGI support on Windows, first, open the "Control Panel" and go to "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off." In the "Windows Features" window, find and expand the "Internet Information Services" section. Check the box for "Web Management Tools" and "World Wide Web Services," then expand the "Application Development Features" and enable "CGI" by checking the corresponding box. Click "OK" to begin the installation. Once completed, IIS will be installed with CGI support enabled, allowing you to run CGI scripts on your web server. You can verify this by opening the IIS Manager and checking the features available under your server settings.

<h2>Install PHP manager from the osTicket installation file: To install the PHP Manager for IIS from the osTicket installation ZIP file, first extract the contents of the osTicket ZIP file to a folder on your computer. Inside the extracted folder, locate the "PHP Manager" folder. Copy the PHP Manager installer (usually named something like phpmanager_installer.exe) to your server. Run the installer, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installation, open the IIS Manager, and you should see the "PHP Manager" option under the server's features. This tool allows you to manage PHP settings for IIS, ensuring that PHP is properly configured for use with osTicket.
